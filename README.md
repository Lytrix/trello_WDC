# Tableau Web Data Connector for Trello (Trello.com)
This is a very simple web data connector to pull down cards from your trello board and display them in a
tableau viz.

# Extension
There is a tremendous opportunity to extend this Web Data Connector. My initial goal was to only show cards "in flight"
on our trello board. I dont capture any of the time data or lane data that is captured by trello. Someone could
come in and extend this web data connector fairly easy to grab more API data than I currently do.
